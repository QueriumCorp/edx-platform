Work with a feature branch off querium.dev
------------
.. code-block:: bash

  # how to create a new feature branch named "querium.dev-oauth" from querium.dev
  git checkout -b querium.dev-oauth querium.dev
  git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/querium.dev-oauth querium.dev-oauth

  # How to merge querium.dev-oauth modifications into querium.dev
  git checkout querium.dev
  git pull                            # to synch your local repo with remote
  git checkout querium.dev-oauth
  git pull                            # to sunch your locla repo with remote
  git rebase -i querium.dev           # rebase querium.dev-oauth to querium.dev
  git checkout querium.dev
  git merge querium.dev-oauth         # merge querium.dev-oauth into querium.dev

  # Push your changes to Github
  git push origin querium.dev
  git push origin querium.dev-oauth



Merge querium.dev into querium.master
------------
.. code-block:: bash

  git checkout querium.master
  git pull                            # to synch your local repo with remote
  git checkout querium.dev
  git pull                            # to sunch your local repo with remote
  git rebase -i querium.master        # rebase querium.dev to querium.master
  git checkout querium.master
  git merge querium.dev               # merge querium.dev into querium.master

  # Push your changes to Github
  git push origin querium.master
  git push origin querium.dev


Deployment Notes
-------
This fork will not install "cleanly" due to UI customizations that are not themeable. Because of these file modifications Paver will compile successfully only when the custom theme for this fork is also installed and configured.
Other stuff that is prone to challenges:
1. RabbitMQ initially caused problems on roverbyopenstax.com and had to be installed. Oddly, most celery tasks worked correctly. Only write operations to Mongo were problematic
2. Assets have to be compiled using our own compiler scripts, located in the config repos
3. Letsencrypt ssl certificates have to be hand replaced.
4. It's not a bad idea to search the code base and the custom theme for hard-coded domain names, as these tend to creep into the code on a regular basis.
