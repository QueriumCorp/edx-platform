    Description:
    =============
    LTI authentications include a JSON paramater in the body response with the key "tpa_lti_params"
    which contains the value "context_id", that uniquely identifies the course from the host LMS which the student's
    session originated.

    1. The LTI consumer is not assumed to have any knowledge of the courseware available on Rover, which presents a
    conundrum with respect to establishing a map of context_id's to Rover's corresponding course_id's. The only
    real-world independent connection between a context_id and a course_id is the instructor teaching the course.
    Therefore, when this instructor authenticates via LTI we can poll for the instructor's course(s) in Rover and
    then draw some logical conclusions about what do about mapping the instructor's context_id to a course_id in Rover.

    2. Moreover, students authenticating via LTI will need to be automatically enrolled in the Rover course
    corresponding to the context_id contained in the tpa_lti_params dictionary of their authentication http
    response body.

    We extend LTI authentication to form a relationship between the LTI consumer (the host LMS) and
    the LTI provider (us, a course hosted on this Rover platform).

    this module provides methods to administer these relationships:

    check_enrollment()
        queries the cache for information about the Rover course corresponding to context_id
        if found, then checks for and if necesary, enrolls the student in the course.
